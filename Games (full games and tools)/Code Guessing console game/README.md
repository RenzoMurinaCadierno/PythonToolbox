Code Guessing Game
========================================

Overview
----------------------------------------

A simple guessing game where the program creates a random 3-unrepeated-digit code that you have to guess. 

It is just a simple 15-minute coding program I have made to explain loops and conditional statements to some friends. I hope you make use of it!

Instructions
------------------------------------------
The program will automatically generate a code of three 0-9 unrepeated numbers which you have to guess.

If a guessed number matches the exact number and position in the target code, then the program hints you with 'Bullseye!'.

If a guessed number matches one number but it is not in the correct position in the code list, then you will get a 'Missed!' hint.

If you did not guess any correct number regardless its position, a 'Nothing' hint will be displayed.

If the code matches your guess, you win!

E.g.:

Code: 123   Guess: 124   Hints: Bullseye! Bullseye! Nothing!

Code: 476   Guess: 123   Hints: Nothing! Nothing! Nothing!

Code: 365   Guess: 564   Hints: Missed! Bullseye! Missed!

Code: 729   Guess: 729   Hints: You got it! It was 729!

Thank you for reading and for using this program!
