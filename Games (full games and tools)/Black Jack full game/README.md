Black Jack
========================================

Overview
----------------------------------------

A Black Jack game created following Tim Buchalka's proposed exercise at lectures 105-112 in his 'Learn Python Programming Masterclass' course.

An excellent experience, which taught me many things I did not know from Tkinter module, at the same time it trained my problem-solving logic.

Awesome course so far! My props to it. You can find it here:

Instructions
------------------------------------------
The game automatically deals two cards to you and one for the player.

If you want another card, hit the "Player button". If you want to keep your hand, click on the "Dealer" button and the game will show the results.

At any point you can start a new game up or shuffle the deck with the respective buttons.
